  <!-- The CAF Champions League operates primarily as a knockout competition, with trim-down qualification rounds,
  a group stage, a two-legged knockout stage and a one-off final. At the start of the competition, the 64 qualified teams
  enter 2 qualification rounds: the preliminary stage and the first round. After the first qualifying round,
  the remaining teams are split into four groups of 4, whereas the teams each first-round winner vanquished transfer
  to the second qualification round of the Confederation Cup for hopes of group stage progression.
  The winners and runners-up of each group progress to the two-legged knockout stage for hopes of progression to a
  one-off final for a chance to lift the trophy for their member association.  -->
